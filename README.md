## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🛍️ [Unified Data Model & Multi-Channel Analytics](#)
**Domain:** Fashion Retail | **Tech:** Tableau, Snowflake, dbt, Azure Data Factory

**Context:** Partnered with a fashion retail brand to solve a critical data engineering challenge: unifying the digital (Ads/E-com) and physical (POS) worlds. The goal was to replace fragmented reports with a scalable "Single Source of Truth" using modern architecture.

* **Challenge:** Data was siloed across offline retailer POS, e-commerce platforms, and ad networks, making it impossible to attribute revenue correctly or track holistic marketing ROI.
* **Solution:**
  * Architected a scalable Star Schema in **Snowflake**, using **Azure Data Factory** to ingest daily data from diverse APIs.
  * Implemented **dbt (Data Build Tool)** to execute multi-stage transformations following the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold).
  * Deployed incremental models to optimize load times and built an interactive **Tableau** dashboard for executive KPI tracking.
* **Impact:** Drastically improved data processing speed and scalability, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on cross-channel performance.

### 📉 [Predictive Pricing & Promotion Simulator](#)
**Domain:** FMCG / CPG | **Tech:** Power BI, Power Apps, AutoML, Power Automate

**Context:** Developed a prescriptive analytics solution for a major FMCG company to optimize trade promotion budgets. The goal was to move beyond descriptive reporting to predictive "what-if" scenarios that guide pricing strategies during campaign planning.

* **Challenge:** Marketing teams were launching loss-making offers due to a lack of visibility into price elasticity and projected sales lift.
* **Solution:**
  * Engineered a Price Elasticity Simulator by embedding **Power Apps** directly inside Power BI.
  * Integrated **AutoML** via Power Automate to predict "Sales Lift vs. Cost" based on user inputs (discount %, dates, region) in real-time.
* **Impact:** Empowered business users to simulate scenarios instantly, minimizing loss-making offers and significantly increasing Campaign ROI.

### 📊 [Secondary Sales & Field Force Analytics](#)
**Domain:** FMCG | **Tech:** Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL, Power BI (Mobile & Web), RLS

**Context:** Developed a mobile-first analytics solution for a major FMCG company to digitize and monitor "Secondary Sales" (orders taken by sales reps at retail outlets). The goal was to provide granular performance visibility from the salesperson level up to the organizational level.

* **Challenge:** Field sales data was decentralized, making it impossible to track sales team performance or regional trends in real-time. Security was critical due to the complex hierarchy of the sales force.
* **Solution:**
  * Architected ingestion pipelines in **Azure Data Factory** to pull raw API data into **Azure SQL**.
  * Engineered complex Stored Procedures to calculate sales rep performance metrics.
  * Designed a **Power BI Mobile** optimized report with strict **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to ensure users only see data relevant to their hierarchy.
* **Impact:** Enabled daily tracking of field-force activities, ensuring 100% data security and driving regional performance accountability.

### 🏭 [Global Smart Factory & Shopfloor Intelligence](#)
**Domain:** CPG / Manufacturing | **Tech:** Power BI Apps, Data Modeling, DAX

**Context:** Engaged by one of the world's largest CPG companies to digitize operations across multiple global manufacturing plants. The objective was to create a "Digital Twin" of shopfloor activities to identify inefficiencies.

* **Challenge:** Fragmented data across global plants made it difficult to monitor downtime, procurement lags, and machine breakdowns centrally.
* **Solution:**
  * Developed a comprehensive suite of **26 Power BI Dashboards** hosted on a unified Workspace App.
  * Modeled complex relationships between production cycles, machine health, and inventory data to provide a holistic view.
* **Impact:** Provided a unified view of global operations, enabling plant managers to reduce machine downtime and optimize production efficiency through data-driven procurement.

### ✅ [AI-Driven SOP Compliance Monitor](#)
**Domain:** Retail / Hospitality | **Tech:** Power BI, Machine Learning Integration, Python

**Context:** Worked with a large restaurant chain to enforce Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) across dispersed outlets. The goal was to transition from manual audits to automated, evidence-based compliance tracking.

* **Challenge:** Ensuring daily hygiene and operational compliance across hundreds of outlets was manual, reactive, and error-prone.
* **Solution:**
  * Created a dashboard that ingested data from backend **ML models** (surveillance analysis) to identify non-compliance incidents.
  * Implemented a "Smart Suggestion" engine that provided corrective actions based on historical outlet data and weighted scoring.
* **Impact:** Improved brand standard compliance significantly by enabling proactive intervention and evidence-based tracking of employee activities.

### 🛡️ [Automated Data Quality (DQM) Framework](#)
**Domain:** Cross-Domain / Engineering | **Tech:** Snowflake (Tasks, Streams, Stored Procs), SQL

**Context:** Designed a reusable Data Quality Management framework to ensure the reliability of data warehouses. This internal initiative addressed the recurring issue of "bad data" breaking downstream executive reports.

* **Challenge:** Manual QA checks on large-scale tables were time-consuming and reactive, often catching errors only after reports had failed.
* **Solution:**
  * Built a native **Snowflake** DQM framework utilizing **Streams and Tasks** for continuous monitoring.
  * Wrote modular Stored Procedures to execute logic-based QA checks with automated logging.
* **Impact:** Reduced manual QA efforts by hours per week and ensured high data fidelity by catching anomalies before they reached the reporting layer.
